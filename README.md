# A Wine Classification System using a Random Forest Learning Model implemented in Java and trained on a Sci-kit Learn dataset

A wine classification system is a great tool for anybody interested in this alcohol. This specific system will ask users for 13 numerical attributes that they prefer to have in their drinks, once entered the system will return a recommended wine for the user. This system doubles up as a classifier for users who know the characteristics of a wine (the alcohol percentage, the acidity, the hue, etc.) but not the name, Wine Classifier will return it's strongest prediction through it's random forest implementation.

## Requirements

1. Implement a Random Forest Recursive Learning Model
2. Successfully return an identified wine from said model


## Usage

This system is created in Java as such it'll either be run through Eclipse IDE or the command line through Javac.
